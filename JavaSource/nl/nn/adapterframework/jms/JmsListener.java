 *</p><p><b>Using transactions</b><br/>
 * Since version 4.1, Ibis supports distributed transactions using the XA-protocol. This feature is controlled by the 
 * {@link #setTransacted(boolean) transacted} attribute. If this is set to <code>true</code>, received messages are 
 * committed or rolled back, possibly together with other actions, by the receiver or the pipeline.
 * In case of a failure, all actions within the transaction are rolled back.
 * 
 *</p><p><b>Using jmsTransacted and acknowledgement</b><br/>
 * If jmsTransacted is set <code>true</code>: it should ensure that a message is received and processed on a both or nothing basis. 
 * IBIS will commit the the message, otherwise perform rollback. However using jmsTransacted, IBIS does not bring transactions within
 * the adapters under transaction control, compromising the idea of atomic transactions. In the roll-back situation messages sent to 
 * other destinations within the Pipeline are NOT rolled back if jmsTransacted is set <code>true</code>! In the failure situation the 
 * message is therefore completely processed, and the roll back does not mean that the processing is rolled back! To obtain the correct 
 * (transactional) behaviour, {@link #setTransacted(boolean) transacted} should be used instead of {@link #setJmsTransacted(boolean) 
 * listener.transacted}.
 *<p>
 * Setting {@link #setAcknowledgeMode(String) listener.acknowledgeMode} to "auto" means that messages are allways acknowledged (removed from
 * the queue, regardless of what the status of the Adapter is. "client" means that the message will only be removed from the queue
 * when the state of the Adapter equals the defined state for committing (specified by {@link #setCommitOnState(String) listener.commitOnState}).
 * The "dups" mode instructs the session to lazily acknowledge the delivery of the messages. This is likely to result in the
 * delivery of duplicate messages if JMS fails. It should be used by consumers who are tolerant in processing duplicate messages. 
 * In cases where the client is tolerant of duplicate messages, some enhancement in performance can be achieved using this mode, 
 * since a session has lower overhead in trying to prevent duplicate messages.
 * </p>
 * <p>The setting for {@link #setAcknowledgeMode(String) listener.acknowledgeMode} will only be processed if 
 * the setting for {@link #setTransacted(boolean) listener.transacted} as well as for 
 * {@link #setJmsTransacted(boolean) listener.jmsTransacted} is false.</p>
 * 
 * <p>If {@link #setUseReplyTo(boolean) useReplyTo} is set and a replyTo-destination is
 * specified in the message, the JmsListener sends the result of the processing
 * in the pipeline to this destination. Otherwise the result is sent using the (optionally)
 * specified {@link #setSender(ISender) Sender}, that in turn sends the message to
 * whatever it is configured to.</p>
 * 
 * <p><b>Notice:</b> the JmsListener is ONLY capable of processing
 * <code>javax.jms.TextMessage</code>s <br/><br/>
 * </p>
