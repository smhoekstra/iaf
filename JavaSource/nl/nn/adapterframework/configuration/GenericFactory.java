/**
 * Generic factory for instantiating beans from the Digester framework.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This factory uses the name of the current element for name of the bean,
 * instead of hard-wiring a bean name. The name of current element is prefixed
 * with the string "proto-", to prevent unwanted auto-wiring cascaded of
 * other prototype beans defined in the Spring Factory which are supposed to
 * be defined in the IBIS Configuration File. 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If a className attribute is specified in the configuration file, then
 * this is used together with the bean-name to find the bean to be
 * instantiated from the Spring Factory (see the rules laid out in
 * {@link AbstractSpringPoweredDigesterFactory}.
 * In particular, the bean-name is ignored when the class-name is specified
 * and the Spring Factory contains exactly 1 bean-definition for that
 * class.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This is useful for those kinds of rules in the digester-rules.xml where
 * the className was always mandatory in older versions, but also for those rules
 * where className is never specified and only 1 possible implementation
 * exists.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * NB: The Apache Digester cannot read a factory-create-rule from XML and supply
 * parameters to the factory created from the XML digester-rules, so there is
 * no way to configure a factory instance with a bean-name from the digester-rules.
 * </p>
