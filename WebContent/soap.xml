	In order to get Apache SOAP working on BEA WebLogic 6.1, 
	this file needs to be placed in the working-directory, 
	i.e. the directory 'bea\wlserver6.1'. WebSphere and Tomcat
	read it as expected from the war-file.
	Apache SOAP expects this file as a 'File' rather than a resource,
	therefore it cannot be read from the war-file.
